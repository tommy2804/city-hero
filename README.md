## :calling: General info

City-Hero is a full-stack project that aims to provide citizens with a platform to report city events directly to the municipality. The project consists of two React Native apps and a React website that work together to create a seamless user experience.

The two mobile apps are designed for both Android and iOS users, providing a convenient and accessible way for citizens to report issues such as street blockages, road damage, and other municipal problems. The apps have a user-friendly interface and provide the users with the ability to upload photos and add comments to their reports.

The React website provides a centralized location for all reports made by the citizens. It is accessible to the municipality officials and provides them with real-time data on the issues reported by the citizens. They can easily view the reports, their location, and status of the request, which allows them to take action accordingly.

One of the key features of City-Hero is the map functionality that allows the municipality officials to locate the reported issues and dispatch inspectors to the site. The map displays the location of all the inspectors, allowing the officials to assign an inspector closest to the site to quickly resolve the issue.

Overall, City-Hero is a comprehensive platform that provides a modern and innovative solution to address municipal issues. It has successfully bridged the gap between citizens and the municipality officials, creating a more efficient and effective system for problem-solving in the city.
